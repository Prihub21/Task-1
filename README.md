# Task-1
Downloaded the dataset from kaggle , then uploaded it in the python (pandas) to perform the cleaning process, so the data which I imported consisted of 8807 rows and 12 columns out of which I deleted one column, which was 'description' column , then with the use of '.isnull().sum' function identified the null values and then then did '.dropna' to remove all the rows which consisted of null values , now after removing it the data consists of 5332 rows and 11 columns , then performed '.drop_duplicates'  to find any duplicates but there wasn't any , so no changes , then converted the date to 'dd-mm-yyyy' format and also had to use '.str.strip()' function to remove the spaces between the characters in some of the rows .
